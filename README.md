# Vert.x Multi-tenant module

This project is intended to provide a very basic service bootstrapping for Vert.x applications which need to run in a
multi-tenanted environment.

This module provides two very basic functions:

1) A mechanism for configuring where to lookup Tenant configuration
2) The framework for resolving requests from a particular Tenant


TODO - setup a read-only non lasso s3 bucket with sample configs in it
